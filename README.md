(ITCH) Inventory Tool to Catalog Hardware v0.1

This automated service, hereafter referred to as The System, allows quick inventory of hardware equipment that does not necessarily have consistent asset tags or proper corporate bar codes. The System assumes the only way to inventory the hardware is via model and serial number description and pictures of the equipment. It is understood that after The System creates the catalog or master inventory, subsequent processing might be needed, depending on how the real-life requirements turn out. Certain information, like model and serial numbers, might be required to be segregated into separate columns in Google Sheets. Still, since manufacturers have no uniform format, the pattern for relevant possible formats can only be determined after enough variants in the Master Inventory can be seen. This post-processing can be done as well, but for now, it is a deliberate decision not to perform this at this stage unless truly needed.
